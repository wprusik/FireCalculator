# F.I.R.E. Calculator
### Just a simple console application that facilitates the calculation of the F.I.R.E. strategy _(Financial Independence, Retired Early)_

The application was made for my own use, but feel free to use it.

To start application, use the jar file from binary directory:

```
java -jar ./FireCalculator.jar
```

You can change settings in the **application.properties** file - it's read from the same directory as the jar file, if present.
